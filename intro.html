<h2>Organization</h2>
<p class="first">
This book is partitioned into five sections although, like any text, if you
read it serially you will find these demarcations rather arbitrary and fluid.
I hope that you find this text at a moment in your learning where it makes sense
to read it serially through, plus refering to previous sections.
I found pleasure and knowledge in writing it this way.
</p>

<p> Part one (I) describes a taxonomy of ideas in logic and computing language,
such as symbols, values, functions, objects, etc.
I don't claim any of these ideas to be my own&mdash;many come from
other programming languages and the literature of great programmers before me:
Stepanov, TAOCP, Dijkstra, Helithy, Ritchie, Kernigan, Thomson, McCarthy, Watson, Moore, etc.
Neither are they comprehensive&mdash;indeed fewer ideas may be more comprehendable, but
they are needed for understanding the rest of the language in this book.
Care is taken to define ideas as specifically as possible for Ad1 but such that
there is no conflict with generally accepted definitions elsewhere.
This section, and sometimes the Ad1 language itself, is called the ``Adstract Machine''.
</p>

<p> Part two (II) describes the computers Ad1 can be used to program, which are those
with sequential processors and digital memory, and optionally additional
random access memory with load/store capabilities. This section is called the
``Concrete Machine'' and it describes the subset of Ad1 which has nearly 1-to-1
correspondence with features of C. The model of programming is block-structured
and procedural-programming where variables are declared with types and scope
information and operated upon by sequences of operations in blocks or procedures.
</p>

<p> Part three (III) begins to describe the Ad1 standard library, in particular
libraries with functionality similar to the C standard libraries and libraries
which use transactional/object-oriented programming style.
Variadic procedures, standard input and output streams, the string library,
dynamic memory allocation, digital math, time, etc. are all described here.
</p>

<p> Part four (IV) introduces generic programming for writing algorithms and data
structures that are composible and reusable. It is more or less equivalent to
the C++ Standard Template Library and draws liberally from Elements of Programming
and TAOCP Algorithms and Data Structures.
</p>

<p> Part five (V) specifies the base state of the Ad1 language and describes
how the compiler and compilation can be expanded and partitioned, allowing
the programmer to grow the language and control compilation
effects and times. The syntax and semantics of Ad1 are not a simple as Lisp
or Smalltalk, but hopefully it is simple enough.
Custom procedures can be added into the
``Adstract Machine'' for parsing, AST manipulation, text manipulation, etc.
Objects in the compiler are transparent and are built up from the standard libraries
in parts III and IV.
</p>

<hr class="thought-divider">

<p> In this organization, you can see my own understanding of
programming language evolve. Part (I) provides a smattering of Lispy and
rigourous ideas which won't make sense at first but have been painstakingly defined
and refined by others.
In part (II) one can glimpse C behind Ad1's veneer. In part (III) one can see C's
standard libraries but also the difficulties of writing them in C&mdash;probably
one of Stroustrup's insights for C++. In part (IV) we have my own opinionated,
possibly naive version of Stepanov's C++ STL, and in part (V) the base compiler and
its Lisp-inspired scriping language is implemented as the prime test case
for the standard libraries' algorithms and data structures, assuming a Von Neuman machine.
</p>

<p> Ad1 keeps C's build system (compile, link, load, calling conventions, etc.) and name
scoping and, like C, Ad1 does not build-in higher level constructs which obscure
stack control flow (RAII, exceptions, anonymous functions, etc.).
There is genius in C and hopefully Ad1 keeps that kernel of genius.
Ad1 ``improves'' on C by replacing the text substitution preprocessor and by
by adding functionality like C++'s type templates and type concepts
needed for generic programming.
</p>

<p> Ad1 is also inspired by C++ and Lisp and their libraries and top-levels.
Compared to C++, the base language is smaller and symbol usage is more uniform
and fully customizable by the user. There are not explicit ``class'' constructs but
object-oriented programming is an easy pattern with infix notation and linear types.
Compared to Lisp, Ad1 has infix operators, a wider variety of brackets,
a greater emphasis on compilation and target machine procedures,
but unfortunately a more complex syntax and semantics which must be understood before
extending the language.
