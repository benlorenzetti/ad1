<h2>Expression Trees</h2>
<p class="section-first">
The &#8477;eal world is infinite in space, complexly interconnected,
and evolves through the arrow of time; while computers are finite
in memory, have only limited actors, and proceed only in discrete
increments of time.
</p>
<p>The parsing algorithm iterates a global cursor through program
script and builds the token tree by recursively applying parse procedures
as operator symbols are encountered.
An operator symbol may be overloaded by <span>if-statements</span>
within its parse procedure, based on bounded number of nearby tokens.
Parse procedures have access to the compiler's symbol tables, other global
state like current namespace, and local context of (possibly) a prior
token and the next token, as returned by a recursively called parse procedure.
Thus the parser has a stack, a finite context around the cursor,
and likely state machines implemented in parse procedures,
and it is said to have a <em><span>context-sensitive</span> grammar</em>
in the Chomsky heirarchy.
<p>
A sentence, or an expression, is a string of symbols, arranged
logically in a heirarchial tree structure according to the language's
grammar. A <em>grammar</em> consists of inflection and syntax;
<em>inflection</em> is how symbols and expressions
encountered in the language are classified, those species and genera
such as nouns, verbs, subjects, verb predicates, declarative sentence,
etc.
And <em>syntax</em> is the structure by which <em>tokens</em> of these
classes may appear in parse trees.
</p>
<p> At any moment there are a finite number of symbols that are known
in the language. The compiler maintains an alphabetized symbol
table&mdash;a dictionary&mdash;as part of its global state.
A character string that is not yet in the symbol table is classed a
<em>lexeme</em>. During lexical analysis, the ``is an element of?''
question of sets is the important one: is this substring of program
text a known symbol?
</p>
<p> Again, an <em>expression</em> is a concatenation of identifiers
and operators, arranged logically in a heirarchial tree structure such
that identified entities are child nodes and operations are parent
nodes. An <em>identifier</em> names an entity and an <em>operator</em>
names an abstract function or concrete procedure to be applied to its
child entities&mdash;and this application is called
<em>evaluation</em>. When an operator node is evaluated it becomes a
new entity, named or unnamed, which can in turn be consumed by its
own parent operation.
</p>
<p> Expressions unambiguosly specify the order and arguements of
operations, and expressions in canonical form can
be compared for equality, substituted, manipulated, and deserialized
and serialized to textual forms (namely written Ad1 and Assembly).
In Ad1, expression trees are all realized as binary token trees.
Token structs have a name string plus additional grammatical
information, such as operator or identifier and
operator/identifer class.
</p>
<p> The grammatical classes of tokens and their syntax are
described in an Extended Backus-Naur Form. A vertical bar indicates
``exclusive or'', parenthesis are used transparently for grouping,
and adjacent token classes or groupings separated by a space
indicate concatenation of those token classes in the program's text
form. Epsilon indicate the empty token/empty lexeme string.
</p>
<pre>
   expression = recursive_exp | cast_exp | implicit_exp | identifier
   identifier = known_entity | lexeme

recursive_exp = inflex_arg recursive_exp tuple_arg
    tuple_arg = expression
   inflex_arg = exp_list

     exp_list = &epsilon; | expression | (exp_list list_op expression)

     cast_exp = (&epsilon; | expression) open_op exp_list close_op
 implicit_exp = expression half_op expression
</pre>

<p> An expression may be either one of three expression types;
recursive, cast, or implicit, or trivially just an identifier.
Usually identifiers indicate a previously known entity.
However, to allow the declaration of new entities, an identifier
may also be a lexeme, which is an unclassified character string.
</p>
<p> Recursive expressions are the most common form, consisting of
a variable length, inflective arguement on the left, an operator
placed as the parent node, and followed by a single expression
to be placed as the right child arguement. The parser reads Ad1 
and hangs and classifies tokens from left-to-right and bottom-up,
but the inflex_arg may not be fully classified until the reflexive
operator is encountered.
</p>
<p> The inflex_arg may vary in length as it is a list of expressions.
An expression list is defined recursively using a subset of
recursive operators more specifically called list operators.
Expression lists can be empty or infinitely long, but the parsing and
evaluation of any individual operation is bounded because programs are
parse left-to-right and the right arguement following a recursive
operation always has a length of one expression.
</p>
<p> Cast expressions limit the length of an expression list by
delimiting with an open operator and a close operator. A list of
finite length is called a <em>tuple</em>. An optional prefix
expression placed as the left child helps describe the tuple's
type. A combination of open and close operators form the parent node,
and the interior list is hung as the right child.
</p>
<p> Finally, implicit expressions are provided for convenience when
an operation could be infered from the semantic types of two adjacent
expressions or when the desired operation is a no-op. Common
use cases are the removal of whitespace no-ops or multiplication of
adjacent number expressions.
Lexical separator operators are only ``half operators''; they form
superset of the open and close operators from cast expressions but
are not paired. The typically affect only lexing and probably have
no semantics or evaluation procedures associated with them.
