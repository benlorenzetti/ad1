The only difference between computer science and math is one of
wealth and work.
A computer's limits are a finite memory and a potentially unbounded
time for computation, whereas math has an infinite
undiscovered memory from which computations can be found
instantaneously, simultaneously (if only you know where to look).

<h2>Poor Man's Functions</h2>
<p class="section-first">
A <em>procedure</em> is <em>defined</em> by a weak, partially
ordered set of statements and operations transforming one or more
existing concrete entities into another set of output entities and
utilizing stacks to automate entity and identity creation and
elimination.
</p>
<p> A <em>statement</em> is a <em>declaration</em> of a new entity
that the compiler will automatically allocate space
(and thus identity) for or is a <em>storing</em> of some attribute of
the entity, such as its object type or initial value.
An <em>operation</em> is the application of a previously declared,
and at some point defined, procedure.
An <em>expression</em> is a hierarchial set of operations reducing
input entities to output entities.
Statements are expressions that are executed by the compiler.
Single line expressions are composed into larger expressions with
list and range operators such as <span class="set">, ; ( ) {</span>
and <span class="set">}</span>.
</p>
<p> Procedure definitions and procedure objects are finite and are
delimited by either paired set braces <span class="set">{}</span>,
or by the beginning and end of a script file.
However procedures may have infinite runtimes because their weak
order allows goto intstructions forming execution loops.
A procedure is the concrete, computer digilog of a mathmatical
function, but in general has less stringent requirements:

<p> A <em>flat procedure</em> defines generic operations to modify
previously known, existing entities but does not shift the stack frame
at runtime. It does not have a specific type signature but it is
always a <em>transformation</em> operation, which is reflected in
its syntax.
</p> 
<p> An Ad1 <em>procedure</em> binds a flat definition to a name
and a  pair of stack object types, called the <em>procedure type</em>
with elements separated by the arrow of time.
A procedure is called an <em>open procedure</em> if it also
touches objects at the base of the stack (global variables) or
otherwise is <em>closed</em> if all input and output objects are
passed automatically at runtime on the end of the stack.
</p>
<p> A <em>linear procedure</em> restores to procedures the property
of functions that equal input combinations map consistently to
equal outputs. A procedure is provably linear if it is closed and
its input and output objects are regular types.
For all procedures, linear arrow types allow the programmer to
reason about stately resources: what members of the input object are
returned modified in the output set?
</p>
<p> Finally a <em>functional procedure</em> is a linear procedure
that treats all its inputs as if they were values; i.e. all inputs
are passed either by copying or by constant references.
