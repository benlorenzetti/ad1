At the king's command they removed from the quarry large blocks of
high-grade stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the
temple. The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and workers from
Byblos cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of
the temple.

Ideas and functions from math and hardware are reflected in our
programming languages and have changed remarkably little since the
first digital machines and procedural languages like FORTRAN and
ALGOL. This chapter describes the basic features of Ad1 in this
context. In particular Ad1 is based on the C-machine, a near
ubiquitous computing model epitomized by the C language that provides:

    <li>faculties for modeling a small subset of mathematical
functions and abstract entities with procedures and concrete
objects in memory and
</li>
    <li>facilities for building more complex procedures and concrete
species to model entities from real life and extend the subset
modeling mathematics and other abstract notions.

</ol>

We start with a brief taxonomy of ideas, which is very succintly and completely described in
<em>Elements of Programming</em> by Stepanov and McJones.

<h2>Modeling the Abstract and Concrete</h2>
<p class="section-first">
A <em>concrete entity</em> is an individual thing that may
change with time and is ephemeral, coming into and out of existance.
One of an entity's most important attributes is its
<em>identity</em>, allowing us to track the sameness of
a thing over time. George Washington, Cincinnati, and the Galactic
Republic are all examples of concrete entities.
</p>
<p> An <em>abstract entity</em> is something unchangable and eternal;
sometimes it is difficult to isolate an entity from its identity or
its value, such as in the number two,
the color green, or middle C&mdash;these are abstract entities.
An <em>abstract species</em> is a set of abstract
entities similar in some way, satisfying some particular predicate.
Examples of abstract species are colors, whole numbers &#120142;, and
booleans <span class="set">&#120121; = {TRUE, FALSE}</span>.
</p>
<p> An <em>attribute</em> is a relation between a concrete entity and
an abstract entity that describes some property, quality, or
measurement of the concrete entity. A <em>concrete species</em>
is defined by the possible combinations of attributes of similar 
concrete entities.
</p>

<p> A <em>function</em> is a set of relations that associates one
or more abstract entities from corresponding species, i.e.
<em>arguments</em> from the <em>domain</em>, with a single
abstract entity called the <em>result</em> from the
<em>Codomain</em>. A <em>predicate function</em> has a result that
is either true or false. An example is the even function,
<span class="set">even: &#120142; &#8594; &#120121;</span>,
which maps whole numbers to booleans.
</p>

</figure>
<p> A <em>procedure</em> is a sequence of instructions that 
transform one or more concrete entities into another set of
output entities. A procedure is the concrete, computer version of a
mathmatical function, but it is much less strict requirements.
</p>
<p> A <em>regular procedure</em> restores to procedures the property
of functions that every input combination maps consistently to a
single output. An example of an irregular procedure is a random
number generator
<span class="set">random: &empty; &#8594; &#120142;</span>, which
returns a pseudorandom number based on statistics of the current
stack.
</p>
<p> A <em>linear procedure</em> is a regular procedure that knows no
objects but those passed automatically to it on the stack. The
shortcut printf procedure,
<span class="set">printf: Str &#8594; &empty;</span> is nonlinear
because it touches the standard output object located on the static
part of memory.
</p>
<p> Finally a <em>functional procedure</em> is a linear procedure
that treats all its imputs as if they were values
