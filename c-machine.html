At the king's command they removed from the quarry large blocks of

Functions from math and hardware are reflected in our
programming languages and have changed remarkably little in the later
decades of computer science, since the
first digital machines and procedural languages like FORTRAN and
ALGOL. This chapter describes the basic features of Ad1 in this
context. In particular Ad1 is based on the C-machine, a near
ubiquitous computing model epitomized by the C language that provides:

<ol class="chapter-first">
    <li>faculties for modeling a small subset of mathematical
functions and abstract entities with procedures and concrete
objects in memory and
</li>
    <li>facilities for building more complex procedures and concrete
species to model entities from real life and extend the subset
modeling mathematics and other abstract notions.
</li>
</ol>

<p class="chapter-second">
We start by hashing out some fundamental abstractions&mdash;just
ideas in our collective minds&mdash;which give useful meaning to
the bits in memory and electric signals on the die.
The scope of these ideas is tempered to the architecture of
modern CPUs. A very succinct, organized compilation of abstract
ideas can be found in <em>Elements of Programming</em> by
Stepanov and McJones.

<h2>Value Abstraction</h2>
<p class="section-first">
A <em>concrete entity</em> is an individual thing that may
change with time and is ephemeral, coming into and out of existance.
One of an entity's most important attributes is its
<em>identity</em>, allowing us to track the sameness of
a thing over time. George Washington, Cincinnati, and the Galactic
Republic are all examples of concrete entities.
</p>
<p> An <em>abstract entity</em> is something unchanging and eternal;
sometimes it is difficult to isolate an entity from its identity, or
its value, such as in the number two, the color green or middle
C&mdash;these are abstract entities.
An <em>abstract species</em> is a set of abstract
entities similar in some way, satisfying some particular predicate.
Examples of abstract species are visible light, audible sound and
whole numbers &#120142;, natural numbers &#8469; and booleans
<span class="set">&#120121; = {TRUE, FALSE}</span>.
</p>
<p> An <em>attribute</em> is a relation between a concrete entity and
an abstract entity that describes some property, quality, or
measurement of the concrete entity. A <em>concrete species</em>
is defined by the possible combinations of attributes of similar 
concrete entities.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="./figures/attribute-relations.png">
</figure>
<p> A <em>function</em> is a set of relations that associates one
or more abstract entities from corresponding species, i.e.
<em>arguments</em> from the <em>domain</em>, with a single
abstract entity called the <em>result</em> from the
<em>Codomain</em>. A <em>predicate function</em> has a result that
is either true or false. An example is the even function,
<span class="set">even?: &#120142; &#8594; &#120121;</span>,
which maps whole numbers to booleans.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="./figures/even-function.png">
</figure>
<p> A <em>datum</em> is a well-ordered, finite sequence of
<span class="set">n</span> digits from a set
<span class="set">D = {dn &isin; &#120142; | d &lt; base}</span>
where <span class="set">n, base &isin; &#8469;</span>.
In a binary (base two) computer the only digits available are 0 and 1.
</p>
<p> A <em>well-defined value type</em>, or a <em>hash map</em>,
is a function mapping a set of datums to an abstract species,
or alternatively a concrete species of identity attributes without
aliases. A datum is called a <em>representation</em> of its entity
and an entity is called the <em>interpretation</em> of a datum.
We refer to a <span class="set">(datum, entity)</span> pair&mdash;a
datum together with its interpretation,  as a <em>value</em>.
Examples of values are whole numbers and booleans represented in
8-bit, 2's complement format.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="./figures/value-types.png">
</figure>
<p> If there is a pattern to the values, we can express the value
type function more consisely and completely than
with an arrow map. The function for whole numbers is a unit
power series
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p class="continuation">
which is guaranteed to converge because <span class="set">n</span>
is finite.
</p>
<p> A value type is <em>properly partial</em> if its values come
from a proper subset of abstract entities in the codomain, otherwise
it is <em>total</em>, or <em>surjective</em>.
A value type is <em>uniquely represented</em>, or <em>injective</em>,
if and only if at most one value corresponds to
each abstract entity. The value type
<span class="set">&#120142;8</span> is uniquely represented but 
not total, while the boolean type <span class="set">&#120121;n</span> 
is total, but not uniquely represented if
<span class="set">n &gt; 1</span>.
</p>
<p> A datum is <em>well formed</em> with respect to its value
type if and only if the datum represents an abstract entity.
For example an IEEE 754 floating-point NaN is not well formed when
interpreted as as a real number.
</p>
<p> A value type is <em>not well-defined</em>, or <em>ambiguous</em>,
if and only if a datum of the type has more than one interpretation.
Ambiguity is sometime also called <em>aliasing</em>.
The value type <span class="set">&#120142;8</span> may be ambiguous
depending on the context in which it is used.
</p>

<h2>Functions and Procedures</h2>
<p class="section-first">
A <em>procedure</em> is a sequence of instructions that 
transform one or more concrete entities into another set of
output entities. A procedure is the concrete, computer version of a
mathmatical function, but it is much less strict requirements.
</p>
<p> A <em>regular procedure</em> restores to procedures the property
of functions that every input combination maps consistently to a
single output. An example of an irregular procedure is a random
number generator
<span class="set">random: &empty; &#8594; &#120142;</span>, which
returns a pseudorandom number based on statistics of the current
stack.
</p>
<p> A <em>linear procedure</em> is a regular procedure that knows no
objects but those passed automatically to it on the stack. The
shortcut printf procedure,
<span class="set">printf: Str &#8594; &empty;</span> is nonlinear
because it touches the standard output object located on the static
part of memory.
</p>
<p> Finally a <em>functional procedure</em> is a linear procedure
that treats all its inputs as if they were values
